# System Patterns

## System Architecture

- Next.js application with a component-based structure.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Using TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.
- Using MDX for content creation and dynamic rendering.

## Design Patterns in Use

- Component composition.
- Potentially state management (e.g., using React Context or a third-party library).

## Component Relationships

- Parent-child relationships between components in the `src/components/` directory.
